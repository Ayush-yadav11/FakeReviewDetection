# Fake Review Detection

## Overview

This project is a **Fake Review Detection** system that utilizes machine learning to identify fraudulent reviews. The model is designed to analyze textual patterns and classify reviews as either **genuine** or **fake**, helping users make informed decisions based on authentic feedback.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and data cleaning
- Supervised learning techniques for classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy and precision metrics
- Visualization of results

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-review-detection.git
   cd fake-review-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset contains real and fake reviews labeled accordingly. Data preprocessing includes text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization to prepare inputs for the machine learning model.

## Model & Approach

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques used for text analysis
- Machine Learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## Usage

1. Load the dataset
2. Train the model on labeled review data
3. Test the model with new reviews to classify them as **Fake** or **Genuine**
4. Visualize results using graphs and performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporating deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for better accuracy
- Expanding dataset for improved generalization
- Deploying the model as a web app for real-time fake review detection
